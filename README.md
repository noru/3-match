# Simple 3-match game with 0-dependency

# Just ðŸš€[PLAY!](https://blog.xiuz.hu/3-match/dist/index.html)ðŸš€

**Alert: it has ðŸ”ŠaudioðŸ”Š**

## It's a personal expirement rather than a full-fledge game trying to entertain people. Only key stuff (in my opinion) are implemented.

## Here's a [blog](https://blog.xiuz.hu/blog/3-%E6%B6%88%E6%B8%B8%E6%88%8F%E7%AE%80%E6%98%93web%E5%AE%9E%E7%8E%B0) about it.

## It should work with modern browsers. If not, I don't care.

### Code guide

```javascript

npm install // then
npm start   // localhost:8080

npm build   // to get bundle

```
